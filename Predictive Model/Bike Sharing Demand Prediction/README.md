## Project Overview
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world (2015).

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this project, we combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

## Problem Statement
Bike sharing provider in US are planning to prepare a business plan to increase revenue. To be able to create a mindful business plan, bike sharing provider needs to understand the demand of bike sharing. By understanding the bike sharing demand, they could choose the right strategies like

    1. Whether they should buy new bikes to accomodate the demand and meet customer's expectation
    2. How to manage bikes amount in station to maintain bike condition and avoid larceny

## Goals
`We have to create a model to predict the demand for shared bikes with given varables like time, weather, temperature, humidity, and windspeed`
