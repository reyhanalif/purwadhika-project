# Boston-House-Price-Prediction-using-Polynomial-Feature
Boston House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression Machine Learning Model with Polynomial Features


## Context
Boston house price is a dataset which contain information about house price in boston area and basic public information about the surrounding area.

The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. The attributes are deﬁned as follows (taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository):

    CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
    ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
    INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
    NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
    AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    DIS: weighted distances to ﬁve Boston employment centers
    RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
    TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town 12. B: 1000(Bk−0.63)2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town 13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population
    MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

## Problem Statement
As a property agent, it is crucial to know the best value of a house so we could get highest profit from selling house and lowest investment when buying house.

We could infer there are 2 main problems that we could solve with predicting boston house price with machine learning model

-  We don't have any exact information about specification of a house in boston, but we want to know the house price estimation so we have a better standing if we want appraise house and get the best price.
- We want to determine a house value in boston based on surrounding area condition, so we could sell house with highest price.

## Goals
- Create a machine learning model using Linear Regression to predict Boston House Price based on area information
- Improve machine learning model to increase prediction accuracy by using Polynomial Features
- Create error distribution
- Create evalution matrix to show the perfomance of machine learning model to predict Boston House Price
